# Stroop Effect Test Web Application

## Overview
The Stroop Effect Test is a simple web-based application designed to measure the cognitive interference that occurs when the name of a color is printed in a color not denoted by the name. This phenomenon is known as the Stroop effect. The application presents users with a series of color words displayed in different colors, challenging them to identify the color of the text rather than the word itself.

## Features
- **Interactive Test**: Users can start the test by clicking the "Press to Start" button or by pressing the spacebar. They will be presented with 20 trials where they must identify the color of the text.
- **Key Mappings**: Users can respond using keyboard shortcuts:
  - **R** for Red
  - **B** for Blue
  - **G** for Green
  - **Y** for Yellow
- **Performance Tracking**: The application tracks and displays results, including:
  - Number of correct answers out of 20 trials
  - Median response times for congruent and incongruent trials
  - The difference between the median times for congruent and incongruent responses
- **Local Storage**: Results are saved in the browser's local storage, allowing users to view their performance history in a tabular format.
